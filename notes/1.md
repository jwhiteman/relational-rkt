# substitutions
- an empty substitution isn't failure, but an empty stream is

# reify [var, substitution] => ATOM | PAIR w/ reified vars
- per susbtitution!
- per var!
- walk the var, and if the value is a pair, walk its constituent parts
- replace all fresh vars w/ their number

# append
- re: an empty substituion isn't failure, but an empty stream is:
  compare these two:

  (append '(1 2 3) '(()) '(4 5 6))
  => '(1 2 3 () 4 5 6)

  (append '(1 2 3) '() '(4 5 6))
  => '(1 2 3 4 5 6)

# append-map
- a single stream, where each substitution is mapped to a stream and then
  appended together. a goal is the mapping function and the subsitution is
  the input, so the new goal must reconcile w/ that substition. an empty
  stream (i.e failure - see above) gets annihilated via append (also see above).
